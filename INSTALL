git://github.com/jwawerla/autolab-rapi.git

If you downloaded the project in zip or tar formats, unpack the archives. If you want 
to build "out of source" so that built binaries are placed outside of the source tree,
create the directory for the binaries and change into it. Otherwise, change into the project
directory. Run

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_DIR $PROJECT_PATH
    $ make
    $ make install
                    
where `$INSTALL_DIR` is the desired installation prefix and `$PROJECT_PATH` is the root directory
Of the autolab-nd project.
